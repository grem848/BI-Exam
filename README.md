## Immersive Analytics and Visualisation

### Proposal for applying innovative methods for analysis and visualisation of the implemented business data scenarios, to our BI project

#### Data prep in VR/MR/AR

We imagine a data preparation tool like Tableau Prep, could be done in VR/MR/AR where data preparation is instead done interactively in 3D. Joining datasets could be done with your hands, immediately showing the effects on the data. You can throw out useless features, by throwing them in the bin, and you can export the finished datasets by clicking a cloud in the top right.

When you are done, you can call up your boss mr. Tong, and show him the results in a co-op session. All he needs is to put on his VR/MR/AR headset, and he can jump right in. If he is busy, you can turn on mixed reality, and prepare your presentation by presenting to your dog.

#### Understanding data in a new dimension

![Game data by region](BI-exam-games-regions.png)

Here we imagine a 3D interactive world map where you can point or select areas or regions, and see which game genres they prefer in each world region, as you prepare your marketing campaign for your new game.

Maybe you are in a meeting with all the company bosses, and you want to show sales for each region interactively in a co-op session. The Chief Financial Officer wants to know how we are doing in Europe, so he points to that region and it reveals data for everyone else.

### Benefits of applying such techniques for data analytics and visualisation in BI

Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality and Augmented Reality are all exciting technologies, the benefits we can use from them in business intelligence, are many. Business Intelligence can be complicated and data heavy, which can make it inaccessible for some less technical people, for them we can present in new ways, like an interactive globe.

From a business perspective, making data more accessible, and allowing for multiplayer sessions, where several BI developers can interact together, could be beneficial and cut time. In 2D programs it can be hard to show everything you want to, and it can be hard to share and work together, but if you share a workspace in 3D, you can see everything the other person can.

Interest in BI could also possibly be increased from school level, if we made it fun to play and work with data. Maybe children from a school class could say a game out loud, and see how many people the same age as them, play the same game all around the world.
We could also show them other similar games based on a prediction model, that takes in previously played games and the players review of them, and predicts new games for the player.
